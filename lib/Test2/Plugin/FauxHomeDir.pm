# ABSTRACT: Setup a faux home directory for tests
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test2::Plugin::FauxHomeDir;
 use Test2::V0;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module sets up a faux home directory for tests. The home directory 
is empty, and will be removed when the test completes.  This can be 
helpful when you are writing tests that may be reading from the real 
user configuration files, or if it writes output to the user home 
directory.

At the moment this module accomplishes this by setting the operating 
system appropriate environment variables. In the future, it may hook 
into some of the other methods used for determining home directories 
(such as C<getpwuid> and friends).  There are many ways of getting 
around this faux module and getting the real home directory (especially
from C).  But if your code uses standard Perl interfaces then this 
plugin should fool your code okay.

This module sets the native environment variables for the home directory 
on your platform.  That means on Windows C<USERPROFILE>, C<HOMEDRIVE> 
and C<HOMEPATH> will be set, but C<HOME> will not.  This is important 
because your testing environment should match as closely as possible 
what the actual environment will look like.

You should load this module as early as possible.

This systems are actively developed and tested:

=over 4

=item Linux

=item Strawberry Perl (Windows)

=item cygwin

I expect that it should work on most other modern UNIX platforms.  It 
probably will not work on more esoteric systems like VMS or msys2.  
Patches to address this will be eagerly accepted.

=head1 CAVEATS

Arguably your code shouldn't depend on or be affected by stuff in your 
home directory, or have a hook for your tests to alternate configuration 
files.

Strange things may happen if you try to use both this plugin and
L<File::HomeDir::Test>.  A notice or diagnostic (depending on if the
test is passing) will be raised at the end of the test if you attempt this.

=item L<File::HomeDir::Test>

I used to use this module a lot.  It was good.  Unfortunately It has 
not, in this developers opinion, been actively maintained for years, with 
the very brief exception when it was broken by changes introduced in the 
Perl 5.25.x series when C<.> was removed from C<@INC>.

This module also comes bundled as part of L<File::HomeDir> which does a 
lot more than I really need.

This module also dies if it is C<use>d more than once which I think is 
unnecessary.

This module also sets C<HOME> on all platforms, even on ones where that 
is not the native environment variable for the home directory.  This can 
be a problem, because if your code is using C<HOME>, and your testing 
environment fakes it so that works, then your testing environment may be
hiding bugs.
